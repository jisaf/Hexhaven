# The Void Expansion Campaign - Art Direction Guide

## Campaign Overview
A sci-fi space opera where humanity defends against an alien collective consciousness spreading through dimensions. The visual progression should move from human space stations (sleek, technological) through alien worlds (organic, biomechanical) to the otherworldly origin nexus (impossible geometry, reality-warping).

## Floor Art Generation Prompts

These prompts guide the art generation process. Replace green hexes with the described floor art, maintain the top-down view, include no items on floors, and preserve aspect ratio.

**IMPORTANT:** Orange (difficult terrain) and red (obstacle) areas should fade out or become semi-transparent/shadowed to visually indicate they are NOT part of the navigable map. The green areas represent the fully walkable floor; orange shows difficult/hazardous zones fading into the shadows; red areas fade to black/void to show complete obstruction. This visual distinction makes it immediately clear which areas are navigable in gameplay.

### Scenario 1: Colony Ship Breach
**Floor Art Prompt:** Replace green areas with metallic spaceship floor plating viewed from above. The floor should show geometric panel patterns typical of spacecraft construction with shallow grooves between panels. Include sensor/light spots embedded in the floor creating a grid pattern. Wear marks and scuff patterns should suggest heavy use. Orange areas (difficult terrain) should show emergency lighting panels and coolant stains, fading into shadow. Red areas (obstacles) should display exposed interior with sparking circuitry and structural damage breaches, fading to black void. The palette should be industrial grays, silvers, and cold blues.

### Scenario 2: Station Alpha Defense

## Progression Notes

1. **Early Stages**: Human technology aesthetic - sleek, functional, clearly engineered
2. **Middle Stages**: Transition to organic alien biomass - biological growth consuming technology
3. **Final Stages**: Complete alien civilization - incomprehensible scale and geometry
4. **Boss Encounters**: Each location should radiate the presence of a superior intelligence

## Visual Transitions

### Act 1 → Act 2
Transition from human functional design to growing organic presence. Technology becomes corrupted/integrated with biomass.

### Act 2 → Act 3
Transition from alien presence in human space to fully alien civilization. Remove human context entirely.

### Act 3 → Act 4
Transition from tactical alien military to existential alien intellect. Scale becomes incomprehensible.
