# The Void Expansion Campaign - Art Direction Guide

## Campaign Overview
A sci-fi space opera where humanity defends against an alien collective consciousness spreading through dimensions. The visual progression should move from human space stations (sleek, technological) through alien worlds (organic, biomechanical) to the otherworldly origin nexus (impossible geometry, reality-warping).

## Map Background Specifications

All maps should use a consistent hex grid overlay (hexagons approximately 40-60px diameter) with:
- Semi-transparent hex outlines (for gameplay readability)
- Clear terrain differentiation:
  - **Normal terrain**: Light gray/blue base (metallic or organic)
  - **Difficult terrain**: Darker shade or visual obstruction
  - **Obstacles**: Solid black or complete obstruction marker
- For space scenarios, background should show stars/void

## Progression Notes

1. **Early Stages**: Human technology aesthetic - sleek, functional, clearly engineered
2. **Middle Stages**: Transition to organic alien biomass - biological growth consuming technology
3. **Final Stages**: Complete alien civilization - incomprehensible scale and geometry
4. **Boss Encounters**: Each location should radiate the presence of a superior intelligence

## Specific Location Details

### Colony Ship Breach (Scenario 1)
- Show interior of a massive ship designed for long space travel
- Must convey sense of emergency
- Alien presence should be threatening but not overwhelming
- Include human crew members for scale

### Mining Station Overrun (Scenario 4)
- Clear contrast between industrial metal and organic growth
- Should show extent of infestation spreading
- Mining equipment should still be identifiable
- Ominous feeling of being overtaken

### Kepler-442 Expedition (Scenario 5)
- Alien planet with impossible-looking flora
- Should look nothing like Earth
- Bioluminescence is key visual element
- Research station isolation emphasized

### The Hive World (Scenario 10)
- Vast scale - this is one entire planet converted
- Organic architecture that defies engineering
- Should feel alive and unified
- No individual structures - everything flows together

### The Origin Nexus (Scenario 15)
- Most alien and reality-warping appearance
- Collective consciousness as physical entity
- Should appear almost godlike
- Reality geometry should be mathematically impossible
- Cosmic scale should dwarf individual ships

## Visual Transitions

### Act 1 → Act 2
Transition from human functional design to growing organic presence. Technology becomes corrupted/integrated with biomass.

### Act 2 → Act 3
Transition from alien presence in human space to fully alien civilization. Remove human context entirely.

### Act 3 → Act 4
Transition from tactical alien military to existential alien intellect. Scale becomes incomprehensible.
