## Monster Turn

Monsters’ decisions are controlled by a system of action cards that **automate** what the monsters will do on their turn in the initiative order. They are **not** controlled by a separate player. All monsters will perform the actions listed on their ability card for the round in the order written. **They will not move or attack unless these actions are listed on their card.**

Note that each type of monster can come in two ranks: **normal** and **elite**. Normal monsters are designated with a white stand and elite monsters are designated with a gold stand. When an elite monster acts, use the statistics in the “Elite” section of the monster statistic card.

### ORDER OF ACTION

[Monster standee and stat card](../../img/rulebook/monster-standee.png)

All monsters of the same type take individual turns at the same initiative value listed on their monster ability card. **All elites of a type activate first, then the normal monsters of that type activate.** If more than one elite or normal monster of a given type is present on the board, then the monsters activate in ascending numerical order according to the numbers on their tokens (a).

*In addition to determining order of action, the number on the monster standee (a) corresponds to a section of the monster stat sleeve (b) that can be used to track damage and condition tokens.*

***Example:** With the setup to the left, the elite monster to the right (2) will activate first, then the other elite (3). Next the normal monster on the top will activate (1), then the lower monster (4). Even though (1) is lower in numerical order than (2) and (3), (2) and (3) are elite, so they activate first.*

### MONSTER FOCUS

Before performing any action on their ability card, each individual monster will focus on a specific enemy—either a character or character summon.

- A monster will focus on the enemy figure it can perform its current attack against using the least amount of movement. It finds the shortest possible path to get in range and line-of-sight to use its attack, and the figure that can be attacked at the end of that path is the focus. This enemy figure is considered the “closest.” It doesn’t matter if the monster can’t get within range to attack with its current movement, as long as there is a path to eventually get within range. If a monster does not have an attack listed on its ability card for the round, it finds a focus as if it had a melee attack. In the case where the monster can move the same number of spaces to get within range (and line-of-sight) of multiple enemy figures (e.g., because it starts its turn within range of multiple enemies), proximity from the monster’s current position (i.e. number of hexes they are away, not counting through walls) is then checked as a tie-breaker for determining “closest.”

- If more than one enemy ties for being the closest, the second priority is to focus on the enemy who is **earlier in the initiative order** (summons are focused on before the character who summoned them in this regard, even on the round they are summoned, and a character who is performing a long rest would be focused on last).

[Monster focus example](../../img/rulebook/monster-focus-example.png)

***Example:** Even though the Brute (a) is physically closer to Monster (1), the monster is performing a melee attack and can get in range of the Tinkerer in fewer steps (2 instead of 4), so the monster focuses on the Tinkerer (b).*

In the case where there are no valid targets on which to focus, because there are no valid hexes a monster can attack from (i.e., they are all blocked, occupied, or there is no open path to reach them), regardless of the number of hexes it could move, a monster will not move or attack on its turn, but it will perform any of the other actions on its ability card that it is able.

### MONSTER MOVEMENT

A monster can move on its turn if **“Move±X”** is part of its ability card. It can move up to a number of hexes equal to its base move value (found on its monster statistic card) modified by X (either positive or negative). If a monster has a move but no attack afterward as part of its ability card, it will use its movement to get as close as possible to its focused target (determined as if it had a melee attack), moving along the shortest possible path to enter a hex adjacent to its focused enemy.

If a monster has an attack ability after its movement, it will move the least number of hexes possible in such a way as to attack its focused enemy with **maximum effect**. If it is a **single-target melee attack**, it will simply move toward the nearest hex adjacent to its focus to attack. If it is a **multi-target attack**, it will move toward a position where its attack will hit its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible.

If the monster is performing a **ranged** attack, it will only move toward a hex where it is within range to perform its best possible attack. A monster will also move away from its focused enemy until it can perform the ranged attack without Disadvantage. When forced to choose, a monster will prioritize losing Disadvantage on its focused enemy over maximizing its attack on secondary targets. Even if a monster cannot move into attack range, it will still use its movement to get as close as possible to its focus.

Having abilities other than “Attack” on its ability card does not affect a monster’s movement in any way. It will simply move according to the above rules and then use its other abilities as best as it can.

[Monster movement example](../../img/rulebook/monster-movement-example.png)

***Example:** Monster (1) can perform a “Move 3” ability. It first focuses on the Brute (a), since he is the closest enemy. If the monster had a ranged attack, it would remain in its current hex and attack the Brute. If it had a single-target melee attack, it would move 1 hex (b) to be adjacent to the Brute and attack. If it could attack two targets with a melee attack, it would move 2 hexes (c) to be adjacent to both the Brute and the Tinkerer. If it could melee attack three or more targets, it would move 3 hexes (d) to be adjacent to all three characters.*

#### MONSTER INTERACTION WITH TRAPS AND HAZARDOUS TERRAIN

Monsters without the Flying trait consider negative hexes (traps or hazardous terrain) to be obstacles when determining focus and movement **unless** movement through one of these hexes is the **only** way they can focus on a target. In this case, they will use the path moving through the smallest number of negative hexes possible to find a focus and suffer any consequences.

[Monster trap example 1](../../img/rulebook/monster-trap-example-1.png)

***Example:** Even though the Tinkerer (a) is closer, Monster (1) will focus on the Brute (b) with its melee attack because it considers traps to be obstacles. Only if the Brute were not there and the only enemy the monster could focus on was the Tinkerer would it do so and cross the traps to get to him.*

[Monster trap example 2](../../img/rulebook/monster-trap-example-2.png)

***Example:** Archer (1) will focus on the Brute (a), since she can get in range to attack him with the least number of moves. If the archer has a Range 3 attack and Move 2, she will move to hex (b) and attack her focus. If she only has Move 1, however, she will stay where she is and not attack. She will not move into the trap (c), even though it would put her in range to attack the Brute, because there is still another viable path to get within range of the Brute, even if she can’t use it this turn. She also will not move to hex (d), as it would get her no closer to being in range of the Brute.*

### MONSTER ATTACKS

A monster will attack on its turn if **“Attack±X”** is part of its ability card. Any damage dealt is calculated from its base attack value (found on its monster statistic card) modified by X (either positive or negative). Monsters will always attack their focused enemies (see Monster Focus on pp. 29–30 for details) but if the monster can attack multiple targets, it will attack its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible to **maximum effect**. If a monster has multiple attacks, it will choose the focus of its other attacks following normal focus rules, excluding figures it is already attacking. Any attack that does not specify a range on the monster ability card should use the base range of the monster written on its stat card.

Monster attacks function exactly like character attacks, and are modified by the attacker’s attack bonuses, then attack modifier cards, then the defense bonuses of their target. They may be performed with Advantage or Disadvantage as discussed on pp. 20–21.

### OTHER MONSTER ABILITIES

**Healing:** Monster healing functions exactly like character healing as discussed on p. 26. With a “Heal X” ability, the monster will heal themselves or an ally within the specified range, whichever has lost the most hit points.

**Summons:** Monster summon abilities place new monsters on the board that behave exactly like the normal monsters, acting according to played monster ability cards of their type. Summoned monsters are placed in an empty hex adjacent to the summoning monster and also as close to an enemy as possible. If there are no empty adjacent hexes or there are no available standees of the summoned monster type, the summon fails. Summoned monsters never act on the round they are summoned, nor do they drop money tokens when killed.

**Bonus abilities:** Ability card bonuses are activated through actions **only when the monster activates** and are only active until the end of the round in which the card was drawn. 

**Looting:** Monsters do **not** perform end-of-turn looting, but some monsters do have loot actions. In these cases, a monster will pick up all money tokens within the specified range. These money tokens are lost and are not dropped again when the looting monster is killed. Monsters are unable to loot treasure tiles.

### AMBIGUITY

If the rules ever make any monster action ambiguous because there are multiple viable hexes to which the monster could move, multiple equally viable targets to heal or attack, or multiple hexes a monster could push or pull a character into, the players must decide which option the monster will take.

### BOSSES

[Boss stat card](../../img/rulebook/boss-stat-sheet.png)

Players will occasionally encounter bosses in their adventures. All bosses have their own stat card but act using a universal “Boss” ability card deck (a). **Note** that bosses are not considered normal or elite monsters. Bosses perform special actions on their turn that are summarized on their stat card. Explanations for more complicated abilities can be found in the Scenario Book. Bosses’ stats are often based on the number of characters, which is signified by the letter “C” on the boss stat card. Lastly, **bosses are immune to certain negative conditions. The conditions to which they are immune are listed on their stat card** (b).
