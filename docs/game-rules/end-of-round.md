## End of Round

Once all figures have taken a turn, the round ends and some cleanup steps may be necessary:

- If a standard [**“2x”** card](../../img/misc/2x-card.png) or [**“Null”** card](../../img/misc/null-card.png) attack modifier card was drawn from a specific modifier deck during the round, shuffle all the discards of that deck back into its draw deck. 
- If a monster ability card with a [shuffle symbol](../../img/icons/general/shuffle.png) was drawn at the start of the round, shuffle all discards for the corresponding monster type back into its deck. 
- If there are any elemental infusion tokens in the **Strong** column, move them to the Waning column. If there are any elemental infusion tokens in the **Waning** column, move them to Inert. 
- Place all active round bonus ability cards in the appropriate discard or lost pile (depending on whether an action with a [lost card] symbol was used). 
- Players may also perform a **short rest** (see Resting on p. 17 for details) if they are able.

### ROUND TRACKER

Some scenarios may require players to keep track of what round it is. A round track can be found at the top of the elemental infusion table for this purpose. At the end of every round, simply move the tracker token forward one space. Note that it is not necessary to keep track of the rounds for most scenarios.

# Finishing a Scenario

A scenario can end in one of two ways: success or failure. Once a scenario’s success or failure conditions are triggered, **the remainder of the round is played out**, and then the scenario ends.

**Success or failure**, players tally the experience their individual characters earned during the scenario and tally the money tokens their characters looted during the scenario and convert them into gold. Each money token looted is worth an amount of gold based on the scenario level and specified on the chart on p. 15. Anything not looted during the scenario is **not** collected. Players also recover all lost and discarded ability cards, refresh all spent and exhausted item cards, and return their hit point dials to their maximum hit point value so that they can start fresh in a future scenario. Players should also go through their attack modifier deck and remove any BLESS cards, CURSE cards, and any other negative cards added through scenario and item effects. This should also be done with the monster attack modifier deck. All battle goals are shuffled back into the battle goal deck, regardless of whether they were completed.

**If players successfully complete the scenario**, they receive checkmarks for their characters’ completed battle goal cards at this time. Checkmarks are recorded on the player’s character sheet and completing a set of three immediately earns a character an additional perk (see Additional Perks on p. 44 for details). Even if a character is exhausted, as long as the scenario was successfully completed, that character can still complete his or her battle goal, earn scenario rewards, and keep all the money and experience he or she collected before becoming exhausted. There is no penalty for becoming exhausted. Players also receive bonus experience for successfully completing the scenario. This bonus is equal to **four plus twice the scenario level** (see Scenario Level on p. 15 for details).

If players are playing in a campaign, successfully completing a scenario will also allow them to read the conclusion flavor text of the scenario and gain the benefits listed at the end (see Scenario Completion on p. 49 for details). In a campaign the money and experience collected during a scenario will be very important to improve a character’s skills and abilities and should be tracked on the player’s character sheet. If the scenario was not part of a campaign, money and experience can be used as metric for gauging how well each character did.

# Special Scenario Rules

Many scenarios will feature extra rules. The following are clarifications for common special scenario rules:

- **Spawning:** When a monster is spawned, it is set up on the map at its spawning location or the nearest empty hex to that location. If a monster is spawned at the end of a round, it will begin to activate on the following round. If a monster is spawned during a round, it activates as if it had just been revealed (see Revealing a Room on p. 19 for details). 
- **Locked doors:** Some doors are classified as “locked,” which means they cannot be opened by a character moving onto them. Instead, they act as walls until the conditions to open them specified in the scenario book are met. 
- **Pressure plates:** Pressure plates function similarly to corridors, in that they have no effect on a figure’s movement. Instead, if a pressure plate is occupied by a character at the end of a turn, it may trigger a special effect specified in the scenario book, such as opening a door or spawning a monster. 
- **Destroying obstacles:** When an obstacle is specified as having hit points in the scenario book, it can be attacked and will be destroyed and removed from the board when it drops below 1 hit point. Obstacles with hit points can only be destroyed through damage and not through other character abilities. These obstacles are considered enemies for all ability purposes and have an initiative of 99 for the purpose of summon focusing, but they are immune to all negative conditions. 
- [Objective and scenario aid tokens](../../img/rulebook/scenario-aid-tokens.png)

  **Objective and scenario aid tokens:** Objective tokens (a) are used in many scenarios to represent allied figures or loot locations. In the case of allied figures, the numbers on the tokens should be randomized when placed, with the numbers determining the figures’ activation order. Scenario aid tokens (b) can be placed on the map tiles to act as a reminder for special cases, such as where enemies spawn or when to read numbered sections from the scenario book. 
- **Named monsters:** Often times the goal of a scenario is to kill a specific monster, either a boss or a unique variant of a regular monster, as specified in the scenario rules. These monsters are not considered normal or elite and thus are not affected by character abilities that target only normal or elite monsters. 
- **Equations:** Some scenario properties such as hit points for obstacles or named monsters are determined by equations that depend on the scenario level and the number of characters. In such instances, “L” is used to denote the scenario level, and “C” is used to denote the number of characters.
