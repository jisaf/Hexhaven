## Scenario Completion

When a scenario is successfully completed as part of the campaign, a number of rewards are gained by the party. These are listed at the end of the scenario’s entry in the Scenario Book. Rewards can include global or party achievements, extra gold or experience for each party member, prosperity increases, unlocked scenarios, items, or item designs. As discussed on p. 42, if a scenario reward directs a party to lose something, they can’t lose more than what they have.

When a new scenario is unlocked, find its corresponding number on the world map using its grid location and place the sticker matching the scenario on top of it. Note that the scenario numbers in circles within the story text do not unlock scenarios. These are simply references to what the story text is referring to. If an item is gained as a reward, players should find one copy of that item from the deck of unavailable items and give it to one of the present characters. If an item design is gained as a reward, players should find all copies of that item from the deck of unavailable items and add them to the city’s available supply of items.
