### CONDITIONS

Certain abilities may apply conditions to their targets. When a condition is applied to a figure (except CURSE and BLESS), the respective token is placed on the stat sleeve in the section corresponding the number on the specific monster’s standee to signify the effect. The condition remains on the figure until the requirements for removing the specific effect are met. Only one of each condition type may be applied to any single figure at a time, however conditions can be reapplied to refresh their duration.

The following are **negative conditions**. If an ability has the name of one of these conditions contained within it, then the condition is applied to all targets of the ability, after the main effect of the ability is applied. Conditions are applied regardless of whether the corresponding attack does damage.

[**POISON**](../../img/icons/status/poison.png) – If a figure is poisoned, all enemies add +1 Attack to all of their attacks targeting the figure. If a Heal ability is used on a poisoned figure, the POISON token is removed, and the Heal has no other effect.

[**WOUND**](../../img/icons/status/wound.png) – If a figure is wounded, it suffers one point of damage at the start of each of its turns. If a Heal ability is used on a wounded figure, the WOUND token is removed and the Heal continues normally. If a figure is both poisoned and wounded, a Heal ability would remove both conditions but have no other effect.

[**IMMOBILIZE**](../../img/icons/status/immobilize.png) – If a figure is immobilized, it cannot perform any **move** abilities. At the end of its next turn, the IMMOBILIZE token is removed.

[**DISARM**](../../img/icons/status/disarm.png) – If a figure is disarmed, it cannot perform any **attack** abilities. At the end of its next turn, the DISARM token is removed.

[**STUN**](../../img/icons/status/stun.png) – If a figure is stunned, it cannot perform **any** abilities or use items **except to perform a long rest** (in the case of characters). At the end of its next turn, the STUN token is removed. Players must still play two cards or rest on their turn, and if a player plays two cards while stunned, the actions played are not used, and the cards are simply discarded.

[**MUDDLE**](../../img/icons/status/muddle.png) – If a figure is muddled, it gains Disadvantage on all of its attacks. At the end of its next turn, the MUDDLE token is removed.

[**CURSE**](../../img/icons/status/curse.png) – If a figure is cursed, it must shuffle a CURSE card into its remaining attack modifier deck. When this card is revealed through one of the figure’s attacks, it is removed from the deck instead of being placed into the attack modifier discard pile. Note that there are two separate curse decks: 10 cards with a [monster icon](../../img/misc/monster.png) in the lower left corner and 10 cards with a [player icon](../../img/misc/star.png). Monster icon cards can only be placed in the monster attack deck (when a monster is cursed), and player icon cards can only be placed in a character's attack deck (when a character or character summon is cursed). Thus, a maximum of only 10 curse cards can be placed into any one deck.

The following are **positive conditions**. Figures can apply positive conditions to themselves or allies through specific actions. Positive conditions cannot be prematurely removed.

[**INVISIBLE**](../../img/icons/status/invisible.png) – If a figure is invisible, it cannot be focused on or targeted by an enemy. Invisibility does not affect a figure’s interactions with his or her allies. At the end of its next turn, the INVISIBLE token is removed. Monsters treat invisible characters exactly as if they were obstacles.

[**STRENGTHEN**](../../img/icons/status/strengthen.png) – If a figure is strengthened, it gains Advantage on all of its attacks. At the end of its next turn, the STRENGTHEN token is removed.

[**BLESS**](../../img/icons/status/bless.png) – If a figure is blessed, it must shuffle a BLESS card into its remaining attack modifier deck. When this card is revealed through one of the figure’s attacks, it is removed from the deck instead of being placed into the attack modifier discard pile.

### ELEMENTAL INFUSIONS

[Elemental infusion](../../img/rulebook/elemental-infusion.png)

Some abilities have an elemental affinity associated with them (either **Fire**, **Ice**, **Air**, **Earth**, **Light**, or **Dark**). If any of these symbols is visible by itself in an action’s description (a), it means that by performing any part of the action, the figure must infuse the battlefield with that element. This is represented by moving the corresponding element’s token to the “Strong” column of the elemental infusion table **at the end of the turn** in which the ability was used.

[Elemental waning](../../img/rulebook/elemental-waning.png)

At the end of every round, however, all elemental infusions will wane, moving **one step** to the left in the table, from “Strong” to “Waning” **or** from “Waning” to “Inert.”

[Elemental consumption](../../img/rulebook/elemental-consumption.png)

Elemental infusions can be used to augment the effects of certain abilities. This augment is represented by an elemental symbol covered with a [red consume symbol](../../img/icons/elements/consume.png) (b), followed by a colon and how the ability is augmented if the element is consumed. If an ability is used that consumes an element and the corresponding element token is in the Strong or Waning column, that element token **may** be used to augment the ability by moving the token to the Inert column. A single icon cannot be used to consume more than one infusion, and **it is not possible to create an element and consume it on the same turn**, but it may be consumed by anyone with a later turn in the initiative order of the same round.

If an ability contains multiple separate augments, the player may choose which augments to use in any order. If a single augment lists multiple element uses, all elements must be used to activate the augment.

Just like characters, monsters also have the ability to create and consume elements. Monsters always consume elements if they can, and every activated monster of that type will gain the benefit of the consumed element, not just the first monster to consume it.

[This multi-colored circle](../../img/icons/elements/any.png) represents **any single one** of the six elements. If this symbol is present on a monster’s ability card, the players choose which element is created or consumed.

[Fire symbol](../../img/icons/elements/large/fire.png) | [Ice symbol](../../img/icons/elements/large/ice.png) | [Air symbol](../../img/icons/elements/large/air.png) | [Earth symbol](../../img/icons/elements/large/earth.png) | [Light symbol](../../img/icons/elements/large/light.png) | [Dark symbol](../../img/icons/elements/large/dark.png)
