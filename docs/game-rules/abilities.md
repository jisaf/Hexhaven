### ACTIVE BONUSES

Some abilities can give a character, or his or her allies, bonuses on other abilities, either **persistently** until certain conditions are fulfilled **or** for the rest of the **round**. These abilities are denoted with symbols, and the cards with these effects are played into the **active area** in front of the player to keep track of these bonuses.

**Persistent bonuses** can be identified by [the symbol](../../img/icons/general/persistent-bonus.png) displayed on the card. These ability effects will be active from the time the card is played until the conditions specified on the card are met. These conditions usually track the number of times a particular game event has occurred, such as making or defending against an attack. Place a token on the first marked position of the card’s action and advance it one space each time the effect is triggered, left to right, top to bottom. When the ability has been used once for each space on the card, remove the card from play by placing it in the lost pile. Players **must** use the benefits of a persistent bonus when possible, even if no benefit is gained. If there are no conditions specified or positions marked, the card may remain in the player’s active area for the rest of the scenario and can be removed from play at any time by placing it in the lost pile.

[Persistent bonus example](../../img/rulebook/persistent-bonus-example.png)

***Example**: The Spellweaver plays her Frost Armor ability, which negates the next two sources of damage against her. She places a character token on the first circle of the card (a). Then each time afterward that she normally would suffer 1 or more points of damage, the bonus is applied, the damage is negated, and the token is moved forward one space. Once the token moves twice, the card is moved to the player’s lost pile and the bonus is no longer active.***

*Examples of Character Tokens*

**Round bonuses** will have [this symbol](../../img/icons/general/round-bonus.png) on the card. The effect of the ability will be active from the time the card is played until the end of the round, at which point the card will be placed in the player’s discard or lost pile (depending on whether the action also contains a [Lost symbol](../../img/icons/general/loss.png)).

Even though a bonus card is placed in the active area, it is still considered **discarded** or **lost**, depending on whether the action also contains a [Lost symbol](../../img/icons/general/loss.png). At any time, these cards can be moved to the appropriate pile, however, doing so immediately removes any bonuses that were being applied by the card.

#### SHIELD

A [“Shield X”](../../img/icons/general/shield.png) bonus ability gives the recipient a defender’s bonus that reduces any incoming attack value by X. Multiple shield bonuses stack with one another and can be applied in any order. **A shield bonus only applies to damage caused by an attack.**

#### RETALIATE

A [“Retaliate X”](../../img/icons/general/retaliate.png) bonus ability causes the recipient to inflict X points of damage on figures who attack it from an adjacent hex for each attack made. A retaliate bonus can also be accompanied by a “Range Y” value, which means that the retaliate damage is applied to any attacker within Y hexes. A retaliate takes effect after the attack that initiated it. If the retaliating figure is killed or exhausted by the attack, then the retaliate does not activate. Multiple retaliate bonuses stack with one another, and retaliate itself is not an attack or even a targeted effect.

### HEAL

A [“Heal X”](../../img/icons/general/heal.png) ability allows a figure to return X hit points to either themselves or one ally within the ability’s range. Heals are always accompanied by one of two labels: 

- **“Range Y”** means that any ally within Y hexes, or the figure performing the heal, can be affected by the heal. Like all ranged abilities, the recipient must be in line-of-sight. 
- **“Self”** mean the figure can only affect him or herself with the heal.

### SUMMON

Some abilities summon other ally figures to the board. Summoned figures (summons) are placed in an empty hex adjacent to the figure performing the summon. If there are no available hexes, the summon ability cannot be used. Summons are represented by a colored summon token. There are eight different colors of summon tokens so that multiple summons can be tracked at the same time, and players can assign any color they like to a specific summon, placing tracker tokens on their summon ability cards for easy reference.

Summons have basic statistics for hit points, attack value, move value, and range value along with any special traits written on the ability card. A summon is considered a persistent bonus (the card is placed in the active area) until either the summon loses all its hit points, its corresponding ability card is removed from the active area, or the summoner becomes exhausted, at which point the summon is removed from the board.

A summon’s turn in the initiative order is always **directly before the character who summoned it**, and is separate from that character’s turn. Summons are not controlled by the summoning player, but instead obey automated monster rules, permanently following the ability card **“Move+0, Attack+0”** (see Monster Turn on pp. 29–32 for details) and using the player’s attack modifier deck to perform its attacks.

A player can have multiple different summon abilities in play at once, in which case they act in the order in which they were summoned. Summoned figures **never** take a turn in the round they are summoned. Summon kills are credited to the owner of the summon.

### RECOVER AND REFRESH

Certain abilities allow a player to **recover** discarded or lost **ability** cards. This means that the player can look through his or her discard or lost pile (or discarded or lost cards in his or her active area), select up to a number of cards specified in the ability, and immediately return them to his or her hand. Some cards, however, **cannot be recovered or refreshed once lost**. This is denoted by the [unrecoverable symbol](../../img/icons/general/unrecoverable.png). This symbol applies to the card no matter how the card was lost or consumed.

**Refresh** abilities allow players to regain the use of spent or consumed **item** cards.

In the case of both recover and refresh, the type of card gained (discarded or lost for ability cards, spent or consumed for item cards) is specified in the ability.

-----|------|------
Recover Ability Card | Refresh Item | Cannot be recovered or refreshed once lost or consumed

### LOOT

A [“Loot X”](../../img/icons/general/loot.png) ability allows a character to pick up every money token and treasure tile within range X. This action is unaffected by the positions of monsters or obstacles, but note this is considered a ranged ability for the purposes of line-of-sight. Money tokens are kept in a player’s personal supply and are not shared with the other players. If a treasure tile is looted, immediately refer to the reference number in the treasure index in the back of the scenario book to determine what is found (see Treasure on p. 15 for details). If a character loots an item he or she already owns a copy of, the new item is immediately sold to the city’s available supply (see Buying and Selling Items on p. 43 for details).

#### END-OF-TURN-LOOTING

In addition to specific loot abilities, **a character must also loot any money tokens or treasure tiles present in the hex he or she occupies at the end of the character’s turn**. Character summons do not perform end-of-turn looting.

### GAINING EXPERIENCE

[Experience](../../img/rulebook/experience.png)

Some actions also have an experience value attached to them, denoted by [this symbol](../../img/icons/general/xp.png). When that action is taken, the character gains the number of experience specified. An ability card cannot be played for the experience alone—a character must use one or more of the accompanying abilities to earn the experience. In addition, sometimes the action specifies that experience is only earned under certain conditions, such as consuming an elemental infusion or if the attacked target is adjacent to an attacker’s allies (a). Some persistent bonuses will also give a character experience, denoted by [this symbol](../../img/icons/general/charge-xp.png), when that charge of the bonus is expended (b) (i.e., when the character token moves off that slot). **Characters do not automatically gain experience from killing monsters. Only using specific actions awards experience.**

Experience is tracked on the right side of a player’s tracking dial by rotating the wheel to the appropriate number (c).
